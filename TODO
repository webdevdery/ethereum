### UP FOR GRABS

Tests
- Use standard tests.

Crypto stuff:
- kFromMessage
- Check all the tweak instructions.

Better handling of corrupt blocks.

Network:
- Crypto on network. TLS?
- Make work with IPv6
- Consider node addresses

CLI client
- Implement CLI option "--help".
- UPnP should be disablable.
  - Should also attempt random port usage.

General:
- Better logging.
  - Colours.
  - Time/thread/channel stamp.

### GAV

For PoC2:

Ubuntu builds
- Raring (branch, local, x64 only :-( )
- Quantal (branch) (Launchpad)
- Saucy (master) (Launchpad)

Server
- Get PoC-2 running on dev server ready for switchover on release.
- Or just run on release @30300?

Network:
- NotInChain will be very bad for new peers - it'll run through until the genesis.
  - Check how many it has first.

UI:
- State panel shouldn't show pending (i.e. post-mined) transactions.


### ERIC

Build:
- Windows build.


LATER:

Trie on DB.
- Move the restore point stuff into block restore points
  - i.e. keep all nodes from last 127 blocks with counter, at 128, kill but keep every (60*24*7)th or so i.e. one per week as a restore point.
  - maybe allow this to be configured.


### TIM

Stateful Miner class.

Better Mod-Exp.
