### UP FOR GRABS

Tests
- Use standard tests.

Crypto stuff:
- kFromMessage
- Check all the tweak instructions.

Better handling of corrupt blocks.

Network:
- Firewall-busting PeerConnections.
- Crypto on network.
- Respect idealPeerCount.
- Peer network traversal for peer discovery. 


### GAV

Network:
** Check peer utility (useful transactions & blocks passed) for when dismissing.
** Respect peer count & dismiss/collect/stop listening for peers as necessary.
** Manage GetBlocks properly; should work for when > 256 blocks away.

UI:
** State panel shouldn't show pending (i.e. post-mined) transactions.

Trie on DB.
- Move the restore point stuff into block restore points
  - i.e. keep all nodes from last 127 blocks with counter, at 128, kill but keep every (60*24*7)th or so i.e. one per week as a restore point.
  - maybe allow this to be configured.


### TIM

Stateful Miner class.

Better Mod-Exp.
