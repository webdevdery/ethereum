### GAV

Trie on DB.
- Modularise overlay and DB.
- Iterate.
- Move the restore point stuff into block restore points
  - i.e. keep all nodes from last 127 blocks with counter, at 128, kill but keep every (60*24*7)th or so i.e. one per week as a restore point.
  - maybe allow this to be configured.

Cache some state
- Contract memory, balances - for single commit into Trie.
